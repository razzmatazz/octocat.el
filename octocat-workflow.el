;; This file is NOT part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; Workflow data fetching, detail rendering, and the octocat-workflow-mode
;; major mode.  Depends on octocat-core.el for shared infrastructure; must
;; not depend on octocat.el to avoid a circular require.

;;; Code:

(require 'octocat-core)
(require 'octocat-run)

;; These commands are defined in octocat.el which loads this file, so we
;; cannot require it here.  Declare them to silence the byte-compiler.
